# `Array.prototype.contains` Tests

These tests are written in test262 format. To run them against the reference implementation (which only works in Node 0.11), do

```bash
$ npm install
$ npm test
```

which will use the [bterlson/test262-harness](https://github.com/bterlson/test262-harness) runner.
