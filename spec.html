  <h1>Array.prototype.includes ( searchElement [ , fromIndex ] )</h1>

  <emu-note>
    <p>`includes` compares _searchElement_ to the elements of the array, in ascending order, using the SameValueZero algorithm, and if found at any position, returns *true*; otherwise, *false* is returned.</p>

    <p>The optional second argument _fromIndex_ defaults to 0 (i.e. the whole array is searched). If it is greater than or equal to the length of the array, *false* is returned, i.e. the array will not be searched. If it is negative, it is used as the offset from the end of the array to compute _fromIndex_. If the computed index is less than 0, the whole array will be searched.</p>
  </emu-note>

  <p>When the `includes` method is called, the following steps are taken:</p>

  <emu-alg>
    1. Let _O_ be ? ToObject(*this* value).
    1. Let _len_ be ? ToLength(? Get(_O_, "length")).
    1. If _len_ is 0, return *false*.
    1. Let _n_ be ? ToInteger(_fromIndex_). (If _fromIndex_ is *undefined*, this step produces the value 0.)
    1. If _n_ ≥ 0, then
      1. Let _k_ be _n_.
    1. Else _n_ < 0,
      1. Let _k_ be _len_ + _n_.
      1. If _k_ < 0, then let _k_ be 0.
    1. Repeat, while _k_ < _len_
      1. Let _elementK_ be the result of ? Get(_O_, ? ToString(_k_)).
      1. If ? SameValueZero(_searchElement_, _elementK_) is *true*, return *true*.
      1. Increase _k_ by 1.
    1. Return *false*.
  </emu-alg>

  <p>The `length` property of the `includes` method is *1*.</p>

  <emu-note>
     The `includes` function is intentionally generic; it does not require that its *this* value be an Array object. Therefore it can be transferred to other kinds of objects for use as a method.
  </emu-note>

  <emu-note>
    The `includes` method intentionally differs from the similar `indexOf` method in two ways. First, it uses the SameValueZero algorithm, instead of Strict Equality Comparison, allowing it to detect *NaN* array elements. Second, it does not skip missing array elements, instead treating them as *undefined*.

<emu-clause id="typedarray-prototype-includes">
  <h1>%TypedArray%.prototype.includes ( searchElement [ , fromIndex ] )</h1>

  <p>`%TypedArray%.prototype.includes` is a distinct function that implements the same algorithm as `Array.prototype.includes` as defined in <emu-xref href="#array-prototype-includes"></emu-xref> except that the *this* object’s [[ArrayLength]] internal slot is accessed in place of performing a [[Get]] of *"length"*. The implementation of the algorithm may be optimized with the knowledge that the *this* value is an object that has a fixed length and whose integer indexed properties are not sparse. However, such optimization must not introduce any observable changes in the specified behaviour of the algorithm.</p>

  <p>This function is not generic. ValidateTypedArray is applied to the *this* value prior to evaluating the algorithm. If its result is an abrupt completion that exception is thrown instead of evaluating the algorithm.</p>

  <p>The `length` property of the `includes` method is *1*.</p>
